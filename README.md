# Fashion MINST Image classification Project

The Fashion Styling Project is a web-based application that utilizes machine learning models to provide fashion styling recommendations based on user-uploaded images of clothing items. The project consists of multiple components, including:

Model Training: This module involves training machine learning models using datasets of fashion images to classify different types of clothing items, such as t-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.
Model Server: The Model Server is responsible for hosting the trained machine learning models and providing prediction services via API endpoints. It utilizes Flask, TensorFlow, and other Python libraries to serve predictions in real-time.
Frontend Application: The frontend application provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload images of clothing items and receive styling recommendations. It is built using React.js and interacts with the Model Server's API to perform predictions.
Image Upload: This feature allows users to upload images of clothing items directly from their devices. The uploaded images are then processed by the backend to generate fashion styling recommendations.
Prediction Display: Once the images are uploaded and processed, the frontend application displays the predicted clothing item category along with the confidence level of the prediction. Users can use this information to make informed decisions about their fashion choices.
This project aims to streamline the process of categorizing clothing items through the utilization of machine learning and web technologies. Whether you're seeking to classify various types of clothing or exploring the world of machine learning in fashion, the Image classification Project is designed to assist you in this endeavor!
